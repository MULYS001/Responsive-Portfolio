**Yvonne Mulligan - Responsive Portfolio**

### My Portfolio
My website was developed using Bootstrap CSS Framework and I also reference Fontawesome for my Linkedin icon.  Each file contains links for:

 * Bootstap and Fontawesome css sheets
 * Style sheet css
 * Javascripts for Bootstrap and Fontawesome

 Styling elements include a navbar with hamburger for smaller resolutions, and an animated sticky footer that pulses as it changes color.

Initial commit includes the following files:

 * contacts.html
 * index.html
 * portfolio.html
 * readme.md
 * assets/background.jpg
 * assets/styles.css
 * assets/yvonne.jpg

Updates to my Portfolio have included some of my projects and work to date, see on my portfolio page, along with links to my projects on 
Github.  I have also linked my resume on my 'About Me' page and provided link to Portfolio page.
