**Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio**

## Overview of Requirements 

The mandate for this weeks homework was to create a responsive web portfolio consisting of 3 pages:  

 * Index (About Me)
 * Portfolio
 * Contact

### My Website
My website was developed using Bootstrap CSS Framework and I also reference Fontawesome for my Linkedin icon.  Each file contains links for:

 * Bootstap and Fontawesome css sheets
 * Style sheet css
 * Javascripts for Bootstrap and Fontawesome

 Styling elements include a navbar with hamburger for smaller resolutions, and a sticky footer.

Initial commit includes the following files:

 * contacts.html
 * index.html
 * portfolio.html
 * readme.md
 * assets/background.jpg
 * assets/styles.css
 * assets/yvonne.jpg

Subsequent commits will have their own comments.

HTML written semantic and validated via https://validator.w3.org/ both prior to committing and once site live.  All 3 pages checked as Ok - no errors.
